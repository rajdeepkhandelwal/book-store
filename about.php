	<h1>About our team</h1>
	<p>
		We are a group of engineers like you, mostly from Mumbai University, who believe that most of the question paper solutions out there today are crap. 
	</p>
	<p>
		5 line answers for 10 mark questions... Answers copied over from Google... No answers for some of the harder questions. You know what we are talking about... 
	</p>
	<p>
		We are going to change that. Our team consists of people who actually know how to write answers. That's right! Almost all of them have first class in each semester till now. Some of us are toppers of our department in the college.
	</p>
	<p>
		So when we say quality answers, we mean quality answers.
